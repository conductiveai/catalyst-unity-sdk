## Events

`Capture`

- Capture an event. This is the most important and frequently used Frame function.

`Alias`

## Troubleshooting

### Mac M1

### ************************************************Building for iOS / XCode************************************************

- If youâ€™re receiving a CocoaPods error e.g. `...ruby/2.6.0/gems/ffi-1.15.5/lib/ffi_c.bundle' (mach-o file, but is an incompatible architecture (have 'arm64', need 'x86_64')),`
- This means you have `ffi` built for `arm64` but not `x86_64` architecture
- Make sure you have Developer Mode enabled on your iOS device, Settings â†’ Privacy â†’ Developer mode â†’ on
- Do the following:

```python
# install llvm
arch -arm64 brew install llvm
export LDFLAGS="-L/opt/homebrew/opt/llvm/lib"
export CPPFLAGS="-I/opt/homebrew/opt/llvm/include"

# uninstall ffi
sudo gem uninstall ffi

# if prompted, uninstall ALL versions

# install ffi gem for x86_64
sudo arch -x86_64 gem install ffi
```
